## Overview

Auth.js V5 Toolkit is a specialized toolkit designed to streamline the process of implementing sophisticated and customizable authentication mechanisms within Next.js applications. It provides a solid foundation and structure to integrate Auth.js V5 seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Next.js & React:** Utilize Next.js and React for efficient server-side rendering and interactive UI.
- **TypeScript:** Ensure type safety and enhance code quality with TypeScript.
- **TailwindCSS:** Employ a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.
- **Auth.js V5 & OAuth 2:** Implement advanced authentication features using Auth.js V5 and OAuth 2 for secure authentication flows.
- **Prisma & PostgreSQL:** Leverage Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for efficient database management and queries.
- **Shadcn-ui:** Utilize UI components from Shadcn-ui for visually appealing interfaces.
- **Bcryptjs:** Implement secure password hashing using Bcrypt for enhanced security.
- **React-hook-form & React-icons:** Manage forms efficiently and use icons for a better user experience.
- **Resend & Sonner:** Manage asynchronous tasks and scheduling effectively.
- **Zod:** Ensure data validation with Zod's schema-first approach.
- **Server Actions:** Implement server actions for authentication flows and providers.

- **Authentication Flows:** Implement authentication flows for sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, and reset password.
- **Authentication Providers:** Integrate authentication with credentials, OAuth 2, Google and Github providers, and refresh tokens.
- **Authentication Callbacks:** For JSON Web Tokens as they allow you to implement access controls without a database and to integrate with external databases or APIs.
- **Authentication Events:** Asynchronous functions that do not return a response, to handling any other side-effects.
- **Authentication Pages:** For handling Sign in, Sign out, Email Verification and displaying error messages.
